						Billy Wilder’s 1951 satire Ace in the Hole follows disgraced reporter Chuck Tatum and his attempt to revive his struggling career by exploiting the story of a trapped cave diver. After a fruitless year with the Albequerque Sun, Tatum and his novice protege Herbie stumble upon humble trading post owner Leo Minosa trapped in a native american tomb. Seeing an opportunity to break a story that will shock the nation, Tatum decides to prolong the rescue operation, bribing local officials and the engineering crew to ensure that the story of Leo Minosa becomes Tatum’s ticket back into a cushy, high-rise office. What follows is a dark examination of selfishness, media sensationalism, and the innate draw of tragedy on human curiosity; themes that are just as, if not more, relevant in the modern age.</p>

		<h2 class="film-theme">Selfishness</h2>
		<p class="film-content">
		After finding Leo Minosa in his unfortunate situation, Tatum calls for help from the local sheriff and engineering crew. However, Tatum plans to prolong the situation as he believes it will make for a better story. To do so, Tatum makes grand promises of reelection for the sheriff if he ensures that Tatum receives exclusive reporting rights for the story and the head engineer an abundance of contracts if he drills through the mountain rather than taking a more direct approach, adding a week to Leo’s predicament. Tatum even convinces Leo’s wife, Lorraine Minosa, to stay despite her hatred of the town and her husband because of the money that tourists will bring in once the story gets out. Tatum’s decision to keep Leo trapped for an extra week highlights how Tatum didn’t see Leo as a person but as a commodity, something to be talked about and to entertain the masses rather than a person in desperate need of help. To revitalize his career, Tatum encourages the misdeeds of a corrupt sheriff and the malpractice of the engineering crew with little regard for the suffering of the man behind the story. It is only near the end of the film, when Leo is on the verge of death, that Tatum begins to act in Minosas’s best interests; but at that point, Leo’s fate had already been sealed.

<h2 class="film-theme">Media Sensationalism
</h2>
		<p class="film-content">
		When Tatum first finds Leo, he learns that the mountain Leo is buried in is a holy site for the local indians and that Leo fears that he angered the spirits of the dead. He asks Tatum to keep the spirits part out of the newspaper but seeing a chance for a more enticing story, Tatum goes against Leo’s wishes and makes the spirits the focus of the story’s headline. In his own words, “Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news”. To make for a more emotional narrative, Tatum also ensures that Lorraine stays in town and keeps up the persona of the solemn wife anxiously waiting for her husband’s safe return in spite of her true callousness towards Leo’s situation. To maintain a narrative for his own goals, Tatum makes a bigger deal out of the situation that it should have been and makes sure that the people that are a part of that false narrative act in ways that he believes they should. This practice of fake news and unethical reporting have not gone away in the modern era, and if anything have been amplified by clickbait titles and AI-generated visuals that can skew a narrative to easily fit one’s agenda.

    <h2 class="film-theme">Human Interest
</h2>
		<p class="film-content">
		When Tatum first learns of the Minosa situation, he gives insightful commentary into human nature to his protoge Herbie; “You pick up the paper, you read about 84 men or 284, or a million men, like in a Chinese famine. You read it, but it doesn't stay with you. One man's different, you want to know all about him. That's human interest”. Had Leo Minosa been trapped with a group of cave divers, his story would have been less appealing as the audience would not have personally connected with Leo. With a large group, the numbers become overwhelming. But with a single individual facing terrible odds, Tatum is able to weaponize that emotional connection to fabricate a story that captivated the nation. Additionally, the onlookers that come to the site of the situation to spectate seem to only care about their own entertainment and their stake in the situation rather than for Leo himself. Al Ferderber and his family are the first tourists to come to the cave to watch the rescue operation, and when interviewed by the radio station, it becomes clear that Al only cares for his reputation as “the first” to witness the operation rather than for a successful outcome. The other spectators even bring in a literal circus and music entertainment as they await Leo’s rescue, seemingly caring more for their own amusement than making sure that Leo makes it home safely. It is only when Tatum realizes the extent of the rampant consumerism and sensationalism does he put a stop to the circus of his own making; “Leo Minosa is dead. He died a quarter of an hour ago with the drill just ten feet away. There is nothing we can do anymore. There is nothing anybody can do anymore. Now go home, all of you. The circus is over!”
